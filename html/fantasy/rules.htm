<center><h3>Auction Draft Rules</h3></center>
Here are the basic rules for the auction draft. Any disputes will be handled by the commisioner, who will seek the approval of the league when possible. All rules are subject to change. If you have a request for a change, notify the commisioner at akeely@coe.neu.edu.</center>
<br>
<hr>
<b>Contracts:</b><br>
Every team may sign players to contracts after each season. The number of available contracts and their associated lengths will vary per league; please see your league setting to determine the contract rules.<br>
<br>
<b>Contract Prices:</b><br>
Each player under contract will cost 10% more than the previous year's price. Free agent and waiver wire pickups will be assigned an initial cost based on their primary position.<br>
<br>
<b>Eligibility:</b><br>
Players must be on your roster on the trade deadline and stay on your roster for the remainder of the season to be eligible for a contract.<br>
The following players are not eligible to be signed to a contract:<br>
 - Players previously signed to contracts, whose contract has expired.<br>
 - Free agent/waiver wire pickups acquired after the trade deadline.<br>
 - Free agent/waiver wire pickups who were under contract before being dropped by the previous owner.<br>
<br>
<b>Franchise/Transition Tags></b><br>
If your league allows the use of tags, owners can use either the Franchise/Transition on a rostered player of their choosing. As with contracts, players must be on your roster from the trade deadline until the end of the season in order to be eligible; however, players under contract who have not been dropped throughout the season can be tagged. Please see the 'Keeper Tags' page for more league-specific details.<br>
<b>Trades:</b><br>
All players traded throughout the year maintain their contract/keeper status.<br>
Trades are allowed after the season ends until keepers are due. Players under contract, players rights, and draft money may be traded. Players under contract remain under contract with their new team. To make the trade official, one manager must post the trade to the league group, and the other manager must reply to confirm the trade. This is the only time trading money is allowed.<br>
<br>
<b>Breaking Contracts:</b><br>
Any team that breaks a contract before it's completion will be penalized 50% of the remaining value of the contract. The penalty will be paid from the draft budget of the next draft.<br>
<br>
<b>New Managers:</b><br>
The penalty for breaking contracts will be waived for new managers taking over teams. <br>
<br>
<b>Draft:</b><br>
Every team will have a budget of $260 for the draft. All costs of contracts and penalties will be subtracted from this budget before the draft begins.<br>
Each manager will be allowed to select 1 player to be "on the board" to start the draft. Each manager must add a new player to the board upon winning a player.
<br>
All players are available to be drafted, even if they are not currently listed. If you would like a player added, let the commissioners know. After the draft, only players in the Yahoo! system are available. Placeholders will be selected for players drafted that are not in Yahoo!, and replaced when the player becomes available. If the placeholder player is dropped, the manager loses the rights to that player.<br>
<br>
<b>Rules Changes:</b><br>
Any manager may propose changes to these rules. Proposals will be voted on by the league. A majority decision is necessary to change rules more than 1 year in advance. Unanimous decision is required for immediate rules changes.<br>
<br>
<b>In Season Rules:</b><br>
See the Yahoo! league for other in season rules.<br>
