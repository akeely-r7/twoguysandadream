Follow these steps below when importing a keeper season for the Auction Website. This assumes that you have used Yahoo! Sports fantasy services.

1) Grab Final Rosters from the Yahoo Site (find your league from last year, and then click on the "Final Rosters" Option)
   - Team-by-Team  (Better ideas??), grab the players and paste (special!) into Excel
   - Need - Team Name, Player, Position, Team
     - Current expected format: 
                                YAHOO - Steeler's Wheel	Ronnie Brown (Mia - RB)
                                CBS   - Beantown Bandits,	"Favre, Brett QB NYJ "
     - Keeping players in this format will decrease the need for alterations to the loading script(s)

2) Convert any changed TeamNames to the auction names (ie, Team A drafts as "Team Awesome", but finishes Yahoo season as "Team Shitty", 
                                                       Change team name in Excel to original Auction team name)

3) Save this file as a CSV and copy it to Auction host, cgi-bin/fantasy/final_roster_loads/.

4) Edit update_rosters.[cbs|yahoo].pl to point to new roster_file that you have just uploaded in step 3

5) Run update_rosters.[cbs|yahoo].pl to update the final_rosters table for this league
