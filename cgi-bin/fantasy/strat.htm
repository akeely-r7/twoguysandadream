<center><h3>Basic Auction Strategies</h3></center>
As far as I know, no one in this league has been involved in an auction style draft, including myself. So, keeping that in mind, here are some basic strategies I can think of....</center>
<ol>
<li><b>Budgeting your roster</b> - The money given to each team was allocated to allow for $10 to be spent on each player, with one $20 "stud." However, you are allowed to allocate your money however you see fit, as long as you can afford to fill your roster. Obviously it would be worthwhile to spend more money on your starting players, rather than have $50 sitting on your bench.
<li><b>Preparation</b> - Ideally, everyone should have a prepared list of how much they are willing to spend on each player. Obviously though, not everyone, including myself, will do this. It may help though to create a roster that you would like and allocate money for players based on that. Be sure to be reasonable, and be prepared with plenty of alternates if player prices get higher than you expected.
<li><b>New Players</b> - One of the main strategies of an auction is releasing players to the auction at the right time. There is no set rule for how to do this, you need to get a feel for the market. If everyone is bidding conservatively, release a player you like and steal him for a low price. If everyone is bidding too high, release a player who will draw high bids but you planned to pass on.
<li><b>Remaining Money</b> - Spending all of your money is probably the best strategy. Any money left after the draft only affects your waiver priority, it has no value during the season. Generally, budgeting is a problem early in the auction, when people feel they have a lot of money, but don't be afraid to spend an extra dollar or two on sleepers to fill out your bench at the end of the draft.
